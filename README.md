# Face_Expression_Recognizer-with-CNN

This project uses a CNN model to identify and classify facial expressions into categories such as "Happy", "Sad", "Angry", etc. The model is trained using a labeled dataset of facial images. This repository includes the code for model training, evaluation, and an example of how to use the model to predict the emotion depicted in a given image.

The aim of this project is to build a robust model that can accurately classify facial expressions from images. This model can be beneficial in various applications such as human-computer interaction, security systems, and automated customer service systems.

Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains images of faces with different expressions. Each image is labeled with the corresponding emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, etc.).

Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The key layers include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is trained to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss.
